                  <td>My experience of this course, WEB222 is like an introduction to the HTML, CSS and Javascript. As these are very new to me and I have learnt a lot of different concepts in it from using tags such as paragraph tag to creating forms and tables in HTML. In Javascript, I learnt how to use different conditions and creating the script for the HTML and in CSS, I have learnt about different styling and formatting techniques. While doing each assignment I have learn and studied many concept and a lot of  times I have used the web222.ca site to understand the concept and assignment. For this I have practiced many codes to try the concepts learnt in last weeks. Overall this course, is one of the course that I felt really help me to gain bundles of knowledge related to web designs.   </td>

                  <td>Responsive Design is a graphic user interface (GUI) design that is an approach used to create a particular content that adjust as per the size of the screen and depending automatically upon the automatically to adapt the different browser space over different devices. The main goal of responsive design is to build the web page that can work as per the user's screen size, orientation, layout of the screen and also on the browser used. It is having a very strong connection with web technology as it works by using a lot of breakpoints to control the view appearance, for this one design is used as a breakpoint over the other design to fix the width of the browser. Next, the same code of HTML and CSS can be served to all of the devices instead of separate codebase for changing appearance of the page as per the device. So, responsive design is used to reshuffle the viewport's appearance. In addition to that, it solves most of the challenges related to the design by adopting the changes in its code and reflecting over every new and old device. For, this the grid layout of x and y coordinates is used with percentage for images that resizes the display appearance to a particular layout. Based on the research it is clear that while building web apps for different devices the responsive web designing is having lot of advantages as it can make the development faster, easier and easy to maintain over time as with time more breakpoints and designs can be added to the web apps. </td>
